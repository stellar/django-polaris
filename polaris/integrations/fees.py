    .. _`/fee`: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md#fee

    Calculate the fee to be charged for the transaction described by `fee_params`.

    Note that this endpoint only supports calculating fees expressed in units of a
    Stellar asset. If fees cannot be calculated using the `fee_params` passed,
    raise a ``ValueError`` for Polaris to return a 400 Bad Request to the client.

    Replace this function with another by passing it to ``register_integrations()``
    as described in :ref:`api:Register Integrations`
    if the fees charged for transactions is not calculated using the asset's
    ``fee_fixed`` and ``fee_percent`` attributes.

    If replaced, `/info` responses will no longer contain the ``fee_fixed`` and
    ``fee_percent`` attributes per-asset. This is because Polaris can no longer
    assume fees are determined using those attributes alone.

    `fee_params` will always contain the following key-value pairs:

    - `amount`: ``Decimal``
    - `asset_code`: ``str``
    - `operation`: ``str``
    - `type`: ``str``

    Each of these key-value pairs correspond to the associated parameter for the
    `/fee`_ endpoint. The Decimal returned will be used as the `fee` value in the
    response.
