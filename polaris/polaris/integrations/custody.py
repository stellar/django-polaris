        which is derived from the ``Asset.distribution_seed`` database column.

        This means that the same distribution account should always be returned
        for the same asset. **Do not implement this method if your custody service
        provider does not support using the same Stellar account for all incoming
        payments of an asset.** Some custody service providers provide a Stellar
        account and memo to use as the destination of an incoming payment on a
        per-transaction basis, with no guaranteed consistency for the Stellar
        account provided.

        The ``watch_transactions`` command assumes this method is implemented.
        If this method is not implemented, another appraoch to detecting and
        matching incoming payments must be used.

        transaction to ``Transaction.memo``, and the type of that memo to
        ``Transaction.memo_type``.

        This method is only called once for a given transaction. The values

        **Polaris assumes ``Transaction.save()`` is called within this method.**

        The memo saved to the transaction object _must_ be unique to the
        transaction, since the anchor is expected to match the database record
        represented by `transaction` with the on-chain transaction submitted.

        This function differs from ``get_distribution_account()`` by allowing the
        anchor to return any Stellar account that can be used to receive a payment.
        This is ideal when the account used is determined by a custody service
        provider that does not guarantee that the account provided will be the
        account provided for future transactions.

        If ``True`` is returned, Polaris will save a transaction envelope to
