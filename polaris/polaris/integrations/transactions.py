        This function should return the next form to render for the user given the

        For example, this function could return an instance of a ``TransactionForm``
        subclass. Once the form is submitted, Polaris will detect the form used
        is a ``TransactionForm`` subclass and update ``transaction.amount_in``
        with the amount specified in form.

        If `post_data` is passed, it must be used to initialize the form returned so
        Polaris can validate the data submitted. If `amount` is passed, it can be used

        After a form is submitted and validated, Polaris will call

        form and transaction. This is where developers should update their own
        state-tracking constructs or do any processing with the data submitted
        in the form.

        Finally, Polaris will call this function again to check if there is
        another form that needs to be rendered to the user. If you are
        collecting KYC data, you can return a ``forms.Form`` with the fields you
        need.

        This loop of submitting a form, validating & processing it, and checking
        for the next form will continue until this function returns ``None``.

        When that happens, Polaris will check if ``content_for_template()`` also
        returns ``None``. If that is the case, Polaris assumes the anchor is finished
        collecting information and will update the Transaction status to
        ``pending_user_transfer_start``.

        If ``content_for_template()`` returns a dictionary, Polaris will serve a page
        `without` a form. Anchors should do this when the user needs to take some action
        in order to continue, such as confirming their email address. Once the user is
