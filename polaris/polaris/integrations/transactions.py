        field with the account number/address the funds originated from.

        For every transaction that is returned, Polaris will submit it to the

        """
        This function should return a dictionary containing the next form class
        to render for the user given the state of the interactive flow.

        For example, this function should return a :class:`TransactionForm`
        along with any keyword arguments to use during initialization to get
        the get the amount that should be transferred. Once the form is
        submitted, Polaris will detect the form used is a
        :class:`TransactionForm` subclass and update the ``amount_in`` column
        with the amount specified in form.

        The form will be rendered inside a django template that has several
        pieces of content that can be replaced by returning a dictionary
        containing the key-value pairs as shown below.
        ::

            def content_for_transaction(cls, transaction):
                ...
                return {
                    "form": (TransactionForm, {}),
                    "title": "Deposit Transaction Form",
                    "guidance": "Please enter the amount you would like to deposit.",
                    "icon_label": "Stellar Development Foundation"
                }

        The icon image displayed can be replaced by adding a ``company-icon.svg``
        in the top level of your app's static files directory.

        The form returned will be initialized like so:
        ::

            if content.get("form"):
                form_class, form_args = content.get("form")
                is_transaction_form = issubclass(form_class, TransactionForm)
                if is_transaction_form:
                    # amount can be prepopulated in the TransactionForm
                    content["form"] = form_class(asset, initial={"amount": amount}, **form_args)
                else:
                    content["form"] = form_class(**form_args)

        In your form's ``__init__()``, make sure you ``pop()`` any keyword arguments
        passed to the form before calling ``super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)``,
        since django's Form class does not accept extra keyword arguments. If you
        don't use keyword arguments, you don't need to define an ``__init__()``
        function.

        After a form is submitted and validated, Polaris will call
        :func:`DepositlIntegration.after_form_validation` with the populated
        form and transaction. This is where developers should update their own
        state-tracking constructs or do any processing with the data submitted
        in the form.

        Finally, Polaris will call this function again to check if there is
        another form that needs to be rendered to the user. If you are
        collecting KYC data, return a :class:`forms.Form` with the fields you
        need.

        You can also return a dictionary without a ``form`` key. You should do
        this if you are waiting on the user to take some action, like confirming
        their email. Once confirmed, the next call to this function should return
        the next form.

        This loop of submitting a form, validating & processing it, and checking
        for the next form will continue until this function returns ``None``.

        When that happens, Polaris will update the Transaction status to
        ``pending_user_transfer_start``. Once the user makes the deposit
        to the anchor's bank account,
        :func:`DepositIntegration.poll_pending_deposits` should detect the
        event, and Polaris will submit the transaction to the stellar network,
        ultimately marking the transaction as ``complete`` upon success.

        containing the next form to render to the user, or returns None.

        Keep in mind that if a :class:`TransactionForm` is submitted, Polaris will
