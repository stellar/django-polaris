# Example configuration for Django Polaris (https://github.com/stellar/django-polaris)
# using Nginx as reverse proxy with HTTPS enabled.

# NOTE: This configuration is not used in the deployment of this example
# application, it's here purely for reference.

# This configuration has been tested with:
# 1) Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
# 2) Polaris running on localhost:8000
# 3) Let's Encrypt Certbot was used for auto generating the SSL config lines,
#    so there might be differences between these lines and lines generated
#    by Certbot in other systems (Debian, RedHat, etc).
